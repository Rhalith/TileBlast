## Introduction

This project is a Unity-based tile puzzle game where players interact with a dynamically generated grid of tiles. Each level is configured using ScriptableObjects and is designed to provide a challenging yet engaging gameplay experience. The project leverages an event-driven architecture to keep various game components decoupled and maintainable.

This project was built for a case study and is not intended for commercial use.
## Features

- **Level Management:** Easily configure and load levels with custom settings using `LevelData` ScriptableObjects.
- **Grid & Tile System:** Dynamically generate a grid of tiles that react to user input and support group interactions.
- **Audio Management:** Manage background music and sound effects with volume controls and mute options.
- **UI Management:** Adaptive UI elements with smooth animations for score and movement updates.
- **Particle Effects:** Customizable particle effects triggered during tile interactions.
- **Event-driven Architecture:** Decoupled communication between game components using an event bus.
- **Utility Extensions:** Includes helpful utilities like list shuffling for randomizing elements.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several namespaces:

- **Scripts.Level:** Contains level configuration and management scripts.
- **Scripts.Managers:** Manages various systems such as grid, audio, UI, and settings.
- **Scripts.Tiles:** Contains tile behavior scripts including initialization, interactions, and particle effects.
- **Scripts.Event:** Implements the event bus system for decoupled communication.
- **Scripts.Utilities:** Provides utility classes and extension methods, such as list shuffling and UI helpers.

## Installation
